# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Studies have shown that sentiments from Twitter could be very useful for businesses and
government entities. For example, through analysis of tweets, one could predict the early onset of a
disease in a region, stock market change, results of elections, sales projection and customer
complaints.
In project I am going to apply essential text analytics tools to the problem of ‘Twitter Sentiment
Analysis’.
In particular, I am going to analyse tweets related to ‘COVID Vaccine’
.
The main purpose is to provide insights on sentiments and main topics discussed from the collected
data. I am also going to build a categorization system that can automatically assign sentiments
to incoming unlabeled tweets.
